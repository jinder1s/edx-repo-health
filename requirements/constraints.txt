# gspread 5.2.0 introduced a backward-incompatible change related to a sheet with
# extra columns with blank headers. For details of the bug, see
# https://github.com/burnash/gspread/issues/1007. We can upgrade once the issue is resolved,
# or if we delete these extra columns. Note: For edX specific ownership spreadsheet, this
# sheet currently contains a pivot table that would need to be moved elsewhere.
