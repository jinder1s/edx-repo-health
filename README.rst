==================
edx-repo-health
==================


edx-repo-health contains static checks on repo structures.
The checks are meant to work in conjunction with `pytest-repo-health`_ plugin.

The checks see if a given repository follows minimum standards.
Each check is meant to be minimum and only check for simple specific things. This is to make it easier to debug changes.
No asserts should be placed inside of the checks.
All necessary data about compliance and deviations should be placed in all_results dictionary.
(implemented though pytest fixture)

Check `pytest-repo-health`_ for more info on check design.
